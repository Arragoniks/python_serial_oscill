STM32 USB Oscilloscope

The aim of this project is to create a GUI for plotting and configuring the 
USB Oscilloscope based on STM32.

There are two types of programs: serial and parallel.

Serial:
    There is no plotting and is mainly used for creating and testing heavy improvements
    of parallel backend. Data is obtained in the main thread and analyzed if needed.

Parallel:
    The main program of this project with a GUI for plotting and threading for better performance.
    As for now, all the configuration is made in the first part of the code in the 
    so called "CONFIG" section.
    Plots are created using matplotlib and rendered in the main thread. Communication between
    PC and STM32 is carried on the separate thread in an infinite loop.
    This program is aware of keyboard interrupt, so it exits cleanly (with no zombie threads)
    on CTRL+C or whatever.
